Global Test
Sample statistic (Average R): -0.325
Significance level of sample statistic: 100%
Number of permutations: 400 (All possible permutations)
Number of permuted statistics greater than or equal to Average R: 400

Tests for differences between unordered Site groups
(across all Month groups)
(using Microhabitat2 groups as samples)
Global Test
Sample statistic (Average R): -0.091
