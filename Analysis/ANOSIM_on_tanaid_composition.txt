Global Test
Sample statistic (Average R): 0.035
Significance level of sample statistic: 23.5%
Number of permutations: 999 (Random sample from a large number)
Number of permuted statistics greater than or equal to Average R: 234

Tests for differences between unordered Site groups
(across all Season groups)
(using Microhabitat groups as samples)
Global Test
