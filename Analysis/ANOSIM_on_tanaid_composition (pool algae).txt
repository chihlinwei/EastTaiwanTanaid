Tests for differences between unordered Month groups
(across all Site groups)
(using Microhabitat2 groups as samples)
Global Test
Sample statistic (Average R): -0.143
Significance level of sample statistic: 78.4%
Number of permutations: 1000 (All possible permutations)
Number of permuted statistics greater than or equal to Average R: 784

Tests for differences between unordered Site groups
(across all Month groups)
(using Microhabitat2 groups as samples)
Global Test
Sample statistic (Average R): 0.528
Significance level of sample statistic: 0.6%
Number of permutations: 9999 (Random sample from 29400)
Number of permuted statistics greater than or equal to Average R: 55
