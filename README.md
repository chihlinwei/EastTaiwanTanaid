# Resistance and microhabitat association of Tanaidacea from Taiwan
This is a data and R code depository for reproducing all figures and analyses in the manuscript entitled "Microhabitat Association and Resistance of Tanaidacea (Crustacea) to Tropical Cyclones in Rocky Intertidal Areas of Central-eastern Taiwan".
## Description
The data folder contains Tanaidacea community data (i.e., tanaidacean abundance by microhabitat replicates), substrate grain sizes associated with microhabitats, and sea surface temperature data from the Central Weather Bureau. 
The analysis folder contains the R codes (i.e., RMD files), which can be downloaded and the analyses can be reproduced in R studio. The HTML files integrate the R code and analysis outputs (e.g., figures and tables), which can be downloaded and viewed from a web browser.
